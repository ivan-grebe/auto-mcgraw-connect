## Compatibility Notice

**⚠️ MacOS Users:** This extension may not work properly on MacOS due to platform-specific differences in Chrome extension behavior and system interactions. For the best experience, we recommend using this extension on Windows or Linux systems.

---

## Installation

1. Download the latest zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/GooglyBlox/auto-mcgraw/releases)
2. Extract the zip file to a folder
3. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
4. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
5. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extracted folder

## Usage

1. Log into your McGraw Hill account and open a Smartbook or Connect assignment
2. Log into one of the supported AI assistants in another tab:
   - [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com)
   - [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com)
   - [DeepSeek](https://chat.deepseek.com)
3. Click the "Ask [AI Model]" button that appears in your Smartbook header
4. Click "OK" when prompted to begin automation
5. Watch as the extension:
   - Sends questions to your chosen AI assistant
   - Processes the responses
   - Automatically fills in answers
   - Handles multiple choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank, and matching questions
      - **Note about matching questions:** Matching questions now attempt full automation. If a strict, reliable match cannot be completed, the extension will show AI-suggested matches in an alert, pause, and let you finish manually before resuming on the next question.
   - Navigates through forced learning sections when needed

Click "Stop Automation" at any time to pause the process.

## Settings

Click the settings icon ( <img src="assets/settings-icon.svg" alt="Settings Icon" style="vertical-align: middle; width: 16px; height: 16px;"> ) next to the main button to access the settings menu, where you can:

- Choose between **ChatGPT**, **Gemini**, or **DeepSeek** for answering questions
- See the status of your AI assistant connections
- Check if your selected AI assistant is ready to use

The extension will automatically use your selected AI model for all future automation sessions.
